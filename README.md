# AgroMitra 🌾

> **AgroMitra** is a premium, intelligent agricultural portal designed to empower farmers and rural merchants. It combines AI-driven crop diagnostics, smart weather advisories, a live government subsidy matcher, real-time market price caches, a peer-to-peer crop listing system, and an e-commerce shop with Razorpay integration.

## 👥 Project Team & Roles

AgroMitra was built and designed by a dedicated two-person development team:

* 👑 **Vrishank Raina** — *Backend & Machine Learning Lead*
  * Engineered the Node.js/Express backend framework, RESTful API routing, and security.

## 🛠️ Microservices & Decoupled Architecture

AgroMitra uses a decoupled architecture to divide responsibilities between high-speed user queries, machine learning services, and database persistence.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Engine (`ml_service/`)

The Python Flask ML service handles prediction requests and vector searches.

### 1. Trained Classifiers (`RandomForestClassifier`)
The ML models are trained by running `python train_models.py` which pulls verified datasets from remote repositories and generates `.joblib` files in `ml_service/models/`:
* **Weather Predictor**: Classifies weather into 5 classes (`Sun`, `Rain`, `Fog`, `Snow`, `Drizzle`) based on precipitation, wind, and max/min temperatures (trained on the Seattle weather dataset).
* **Fertilizer Recommender**: Suggests optimal blends (Urea, DAP, NPK variants) based on temperature, soil moisture, humidity, NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium) metrics, and crop type.
* **Crop Recommender**: Recommends high-yield crop options based on soil chemicals and rainfall (trained on Harvestify data).

### 2. Natural Language Processing & Search
* **Subsidy FAQ Assistant**: Uses a TF-IDF text similarity chatbot matching user queries to government rules in `subsidy_faqs.json`. Matches are calculated using a hybrid scoring algorithm combining Cosine similarity (TF-IDF vectorizer), string sequence ratios, and keyword tags.
* **Website QA Assistant**: Similar hybrid vectorizer indexing Express database FAQs and approved questions to guide users on platform features.

## ⚡ High-Resiliency Fallback Mode

If the Python Flask ML service is offline, the Node.js/Express server **automatically detects the connection failure and triggers fallback systems**:
1. **AI Chatbots**: Directly routes `/query/website` and `/query/subsidy` to the **Google Gemini API** (`gemini-2.5-flash`) using your configured API key to maintain a fully conversational support bot.
2. **Weather Advisories**: Runs local rule-based heuristics based on rain, temperature, and wind thresholds.
3. **Fertilizer Recommendations**: Queries Gemini API using soil parameters, falling back to a balanced NPK 14-35-14 rule if Gemini is also unreachable.
4. **Subsidies Matcher**: Directly reads and parses the raw local CSV dataset `ml_service/data/subsidies.csv` to calculate percentages and output scheme rules.

## ✨ Core Features & Visual Flows

### 🌦️ AI Weather Predictions & Advisories
* Connects to OpenWeatherMap API for live coordinates.
* Pulls a 5-day daily forecast, aggregates stats, and passes them through the ML model to output a custom agricultural advisory (e.g. warning against spraying pesticides before forecasted rain).

### 🧪 Soil Health & Diagnostics Request
* **Diagnostics Slot**: Farmers can request a soil sample pickup by selecting a date and shipping address.
* **Admin Results Logging**: Admins analyze collected soil samples and upload NPK readings, pH, moisture, and recommendations directly to the database.
* **Import to Advisor**: Farmers import NPK profiles directly into the Fertilizer Advisor tool from their profile with one click.

### 🎁 Government Subsidies & Schemes Matcher
* Scans over 80 active schemes (PM-Kisan, PM-KUSUM, Rythu Bandhu, etc.).
* Calculates custom percentage matching scores based on a farmer's state, crop, land acres, and annual income.

### 🤝 Peer-to-Peer Crop Listings
* Farmers can list their crops/seeds for sale, complete with Cloudinary hosted images.
* Listings go through an Admin approval queue to ensure quality control and prevent spam.

### 🛒 Shop & E-Commerce
* Custom database-backed product catalogs.
* Razorpay payment gateway checkout integration.
* Order history dashboard with review/rating controls limited only to verified buyers of delivered products.

### 🔒 Admin Security Console
* Logs security audit events, analyst session details, user banning/unbanning controls, shop product CRUD, and soil diagnostics logs.

## 🚀 Setup & Launch Steps

### 1. Download Datasets & Train AI Models
Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed:
```bash
cd ml_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train_models.py
```

### 2. Start ML Flask API
```bash
python app.py
# Runs ML services locally on port 5050
```

### 3. Initialize Express Server
```bash
cd ../server
npm install
npm start (or node index.js)
# Runs Express server on port 5000. Auto-seeds defaults on connection.
```

### 4. Build/Run React Frontend
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
npm start
# Launches the browser interface locally on port 3000
```
*(Alternatively, run `npm run build` inside `client/` and allow the Node backend server to serve the client index statically on port 5000).*
